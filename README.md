# HandsOn-LLMs
Large language models (LLMs) have had a profound and far-reaching impact on the world. By enabling machines to understand better and generate human-like language, LLMs have opened new possibilities in AI and impacted entire industries.


provides a comprehensive and highly visual introduction to the world of LLMs, covering both the conceptual foundations and practical applications. From word representations that preceded deep learning to the cutting-edge (at the time of this writing) Transformer architecture, we will explore the history and evolution of LLMs. We delve into the inner workings of LLMs, exploring their architectures, training methods, and fine-tuning techniques. We also examine various applications of LLMs in text classification, clustering, topic modeling, chatbots, search engines, and more.
